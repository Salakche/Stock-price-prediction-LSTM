# Stock price prediction using LSTM
This project demonstrates how to predict future stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells implemented in TensorFlow. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

## Data

Please find the required dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse/data), make sure to unzip the file and feed the path to the dataset accordingly in the code.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and sequence generation for stock price data.
- **Model**: LSTM-based architecture for time-series prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure model performance.
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots for stock prices, volume, and prediction accuracy.
